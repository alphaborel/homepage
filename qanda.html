        <h1> Some questions and answers about me for you to consider.</h1>

        <div class="questionBox">
            <p class="question">Q. What education have you had?</p>
            <p class="answer">A. I&#39;ve taken some community college from GCC with Information Systems classes. These days, I am self taught through sites like Lynda, Treehouse, Udemy and others. Though, I find I can accelerate my learning even more if I work with a team and a mentor. I love to read and participate in educational programs of all types. </p>

        <div class="questionBox">
            <p class="question">Q. You mentioned that the Honeywell Operating System (HOS) is similar to Agile using Scrum. In what ways is it similar?</p>
            <p class="answer">A. It was designed to monitor and communicate work to the team. We had daily stand up meetings and a rotating kiosk with four different categories. Similar to Scrum task board methodology. There was also a Flow Specialist to guide the team. Similar to a Scrum Master.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="questionBox">
            <p class="question">Q. What Operating System do you prefer?</p>
            <p class="answer">A. Currently it&#39;s Windows. I&#39;ve installed and used many OSs over the years including OSX, and several distributions of Linux but I keep coming back to Windows. I can feel at home with most operating systems but I find that I am most productive on a windows machine.</p>

        <div class="questionBox">
            <p class="question">Q. What is your web development workflow?</p>
            <p class="answer">A. I am still developing a workflow. Right now, I jump right into coding with a rough idea of what I want things to look like and fill in the details as I go along. My editor of choice is Brackets by Adobe and I use Photoshop to process graphics for my project. Hand coding, with a few code snippets and my notes to move things along.</p>

        <div class="questionBox">
            <p class="question">Q. Can you pass a drug test?</p>
            <p class="answer">A. Absolutely. </p>
